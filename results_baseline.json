Leaderless or rotating-leader approaches (e.g., HotStuff, Tendermint variants) improve liveness under churn but increase message complexity.\n\n[SELECT: rotating-leader BFT | because: balances coordination simplicity with fault tolerance and avoids single-leader stalls]\n\n[CLAIM: consensus proceeds in rounds with proposer rotation and quorum voting]\n\nCore components:\n\n* Proposer rotation per round\n* Proposal broadcast\n* Quorum certificate formation via signed votes\n* Commit when quorum is reached across phases\n\n[CLAIM: safety is guaranteed by quorum intersection; liveness by eventual synchrony]\n\nTo handle Byzantine behavior:\n\n* Require cryptographic signatures on messages\n* Use quorum size \u2265 2f+1 out of 3f+1 nodes\n* Ignore or blacklist equivocating nodes\n* Implement timeout-driven view changes\n\n[BRANCH: optimistic fast path vs always-three-phase commit]\n\nFast paths reduce latency under low fault conditions but add complexity.
